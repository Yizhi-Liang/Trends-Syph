The fetal deaths were downloaded from [CDC WONDER database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/), accessed on Nov 26, 2024.

They can also be accessed from [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm) as flatfiles.

Given the substantial size of the datasets, we did not include them in this repository.
