The natality data (birth certificate data) were downloaded from [the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) website](https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data), accessed on Apr 22, 2024.

They can also be accessed from [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm) as flatfiles.

Given the substantial size of the datasets, we did not include them in this repository.
